# Sediment Core Analysis Toolkit

Open-source software for analysing sediment core images with a focus on colour metrics and geochemical interpretation.  
Tools include core extraction, colour-space analysis (RGB, CIELAB, Munsell), measurement utilities, and geological annotation.  
Developed as a continuation of the original Sedivis project.

---

## Features

- Core extraction from scanned or photographed images  
- Colour-space analysis (RGB, CIELAB, Munsell)  
- Munsell calibration workflows  
- Depth and distance measurement tools  
- Geological and lithology annotation  
- Export of colour and annotation data (CSV and related formats)

---

## Status

**Early development.**  
Architecture, APIs, and UI components may change as the project evolves.

---

## Project Goals

- Provide a reproducible, science-focused workflow for sediment core analysis  
- Integrate colour metrics with geochemical interpretation  
- Keep UI and analysis logic clearly separated  
- Support scripting and extensible analysis pipelines  

---

## Installation

Installation instructions will be added once the initial build structure stabilises.

Planned approach:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoshMance/sediment-core-analysis.git
cd sediment-core-analysis
```

Then build the Avalonia application using the .NET SDK once the solution structure is available.

---

## Usage

Documentation and examples will be added as components become available.
